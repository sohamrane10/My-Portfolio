# My-Portfolio
I built a clean, responsive portfolio using HTML and CSS, showcasing my academic background, projects, and skills. It features intuitive navigation, linking to detailed descriptions of my machine learning and web development work. The design is minimalistic and user-friendly, ensuring smooth performance across devices.
