<p>Greetings, I’m Soham Rane, a third-year student pursuing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science 
at Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Mumbai University. My expertise spans languages like C, C++, 
Python, R, SQL, and Data Structures and Algorithms, while my problem-solving skills are actively sharpened 
through platforms like Leetcode and CodeChef. I am also exploring R language and working on projects with 
the MERN stack, blending machine learning and web development for a broader skill set.</p><br />

<p>I’ve completed significant projects, including Iris Flower Classification, Automobile Value Prediction 
on Microsoft Azure, Tic Tac Toe using React JS, Online Transaction Fraud Detection using Machine Learning,
and Social Network Analysis using R. Each project has helped me deepen my understanding of algorithms, web 
technologies, and predictive modeling.</p><br />

<p>In addition to coursework, I have completed a 10-week AICTE-approved Google AI & ML virtual internship, 
where I worked on machine learning models and CNNs. My internship at InTrainz involved Python and machine 
learning, focusing on fraud detection, while I honed GUI skills at CodeSprint Technologies. I also gained 
exposure to Microsoft Azure at NovaNectar Services Pvt. Ltd.</p><br />

<p>Successfully cleared the Python exam on HackerRank, further honing my programming skills. Successfully 
cleared the Python exam on HackerRank, further honing my programming skills. Participated in the National 
Coding League hackathon, tackling 4 challenging DSA problems. Proud to have qualified till the regional round,
gaining valuable coding experience along the way!</p><br />

<p>Beyond academics, I have obtained certifications in Data Analytics & Visualization from Accenture, 
Machine Learning Specialization from Stanford through DeepLearning.AI, and completed neural networks and 
TensorFlow challenges with Google Developers Group. Outside my technical pursuits, I enjoy video editing 
and football to keep my creativity and balance intact.</p><br /></section>
